ILUA README.txt
---------------

ILUA is an interactive Lua interpreter, based on work by Steve Donovan.

Usage: lua ilua.lua [options...]

The original ILUA and documentation can be obtained here:

http://lua-users.org/wiki/InteractiveLua 

If you want readline support, you'll need to install a Lua readline
module, or compile the included readline.c from Steve Donovan.
See http://lua-users.org/wiki/BuildingModules for instructions for
building Lua modules on your platform.
