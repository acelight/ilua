Lua Readline Binding
====================

Description:
A simple readline binding for Lua, originally written by Steve Donovan.
This is *hopefully* an updated version of the binding. It should be compatible with Lua 5.2.
Is adapated from the source of ilua

Changes:
- Includes changes from Reuben Thomas's rlcompleter
- A minor change to readline.c to get it to compile with 5.2
- A Make file is included (I'm on x64 - might need to be difference for i686)

Note:
I'm not supporting the ilua.lua - just readline.c
